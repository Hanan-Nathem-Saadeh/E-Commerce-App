# Vulnerability Report:

## 1- weak and not hashed password
Hackers can easily guess thousands of passwords via a brute force attack in a matter of seconds. we let the users insert strong passwords with multiple constraints,like:
- Passwords must be at least 6 characters.  
- Passwords must have at least one non alphanumeric character.  
- Passwords must have at least one lowercase ('a'-'z').
- Passwords must have at least one uppercase ('A'-'Z').  
---
## 2- UnHashed passwords
- Not hashing the password and saving it in the database as it is, will give the hackers a chance to hack or steal easily the passwords.  
- we use the identity which helps us to hash the password and then save it in the database .    
---
## 3- Weak Authentication and Authorization

- Not checking the registration process, not checking the identity of the user in the system, or don't give the users any roles or policies make a big risk to the application.
-  we solve this problem by using the identity and the cookies to check if the user is authenticated to log the site. We give a role and claÙ‡m for every user who signs up to our system to give him specice permissions.
